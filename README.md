# Ellipsis HTML Elements

Mini tool to align HTML elements along an ellipse or a part of an ellipse. So you can arrange your HTML items along an
 ellipse easily without using canvas or any complex math functions.

**ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž [Online Demo](https://behnamazimi.github.io/ellipsis-html/)**

### Installation

Using npm:
```
npm install ellipsis-html
```

Using yarn:
```
yarn add ellipsis-html
```

Using unpkg CDN
```
<script src="http://unpkg.com/ellipsis-html/lib/ellipsis-html.min.js"></script>
```

### Usage
First, import `ellipsis-html` to your project. You can do it by adding the script tag that mentioned above, or you can
 import it as a module like this.
```javascript
import EllipsisHTML from "ellipsis-html";
``` 
 
After adding the library to your project, you can call it like this.
```javascript
const myEllipse = new EllipsisHTML(htmlElement, options)
``` 

There are two arguments that you should pass to the `EllipsisHTML`:
* **htmlElement:** the target element that you want to ellipse its child
* **options:** properties to shape your ellipse. You can see all in below table. 

#### Options

Property | Value | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
type | `equal`/`compact` | `equal` | Layout type of the ellipse. there are two types, equal and compact. The distance between items will be equal in "equal" mode. 
size | [0, 1] | 0.5 | Size of ellipse. Its a number between 0 and 1. if you want a entire ellipse it must be 1.
rotate | [0, 360] | 0 | Use this property to rotate ellipse. It could be a number between 0 and 360.  
reflection | [-1, +1] | 1 | Use this to mirroring the ellipse. its standard value is a number in range of [-1,+1] but you can set any numbers. for example, value 2 means two times height for the ellipse.   
shiftX | number | 0 | To shift whole layout to **right** or **left**. The value could be both positive and negative.
shiftY | number | 0 | To shift whole layout to **up** or **down**. The value could be both positive and negative.   

#### Render with new options
To update initial options you can use `.update(newOptions)` API. this method merges new options with the previous object 
and rerender the ellipse.   

### Example
```javascript
const elm = document.getElementById("demo");
const options = {
    type: "equal",  // compact, equal
    size: .5,       // 0, 1
    rotate: 5,      // 0, 360
    reflection: 1,  // 0, 1, only in compact layout
    reverse: false, 
    shiftX: 0,      // any number
    shiftY: 0,      // any number
}
const myEllipse = new EllipsisHTML(elm, options)

// to update options and rerender the ellipse
myEllipse.update({type: "compact", size: 1})
```
