<script src="http://unpkg.com/ellipse-elements/lib/ellipse-elements.min.js"></script>
```

### Usage
After importing `ellipse-elements` to your project, you can call it like this,
```javascript
const myEllipse = new EllipseElements(htmlElement, options)
``` 

There are two arguments that you should pass to the `EllipseElements`:
* **htmlElement:** the target element that you want to ellipse its child
* **options:** properties to shape your ellipse. You can see all in below table. 

#### Options

Property | Value | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
type | equal/compact | `equal` | Layout type of the ellipse. there are two types, equal and compact. The distance between items will be equal in "equal" mode. 
size | [0, 1] | 0.5 | Size of ellipse. Its a number between 0 and 1. if you want a entire ellipse it must be 1.
rotate | [0, 360] | 0 | Use this property to rotate ellipse. It could be a number between 0 and 360.  
reflection | [-1, +1] | 1 | Use this to mirroring the ellipse. its standard value is a number in range of [-1,+1] but you can set any numbers. for example, value 2 means two times height for the ellipse.   

#### Render with new options
To update initial options you can use `.update(newOptions)` api. this method merges new options with the previous object 
and rerender the ellipse.   

### Example
```javascript
const elm = document.getElementById("demo");
const options = {
    type: "equal", // compact, equal
    size: .5, // 0, 1
    rotate: 5, // 0, 360
    reflection: 1, // 0, 1, only in compact layout
    reverse: false
}
const htmlEllipse = new EllipseElements(elm, options)

// to update options and rerender the ellipse
htmlEllipse.update({size: 1})
```
